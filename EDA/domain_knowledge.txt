In banking, understanding the risk of loan defaults involves several key factors:

Transaction History: Regular deposits suggest income stability, while erratic deposits or large withdrawals could signal risk.
Loan Amount: Large loans relative to income may indicate a higher likelihood of default.
Credit Card Usage: High credit card spending can reflect financial stress.
Demographics: Factors like unemployment rates and economic conditions in a district can influence loan repayment abilities.
GPA Loan System: The GPA score assesses a customerâ€™s creditworthiness based on past interactions, such as timely loan payments, savings habits, and account behavior.

This analysis will help banks identify patterns that predict loan defaults, allowing them to make better lending decisions and manage risk more effectively.
